## Getting Started

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/orders-management.git
cd orders-management

Build and Run
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw spring-boot:run

Database Setup

Flyway handles database migrations automatically. Example table:

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    person_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    amount INT NOT NULL
);


Place migration files in src/main/resources/db/migration.
